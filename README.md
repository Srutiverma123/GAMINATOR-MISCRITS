# GAMINATOR-MISCRITS
Miscrits is a turn based combat game, consisting of mythical creatures. You will wander around in a magical forest that contains these creatures, searching for creatures to 
fight against, and defeat them. Player will be playing the role of a miscrit which will fight with six other miscrits. 

# GAME MECHANICS
The game requires you to grind which needs the player to defeat the enemies to boost up his health and attack power so he can defeat the boss witch who is very powerful having 
250+ health points and higher attack power. Every time you defeat a miscrit from the pool of 6 miscrits, player miscrit’s health and attack will be boosted by 10% and this 10% 
will depend on the enemy stats (health and attack). If a miscrit’s attack power is stronger than the other miscrit than his opponent miscrit will lose more points whenever the 
miscrit attacks. Each miscrit has different health and have either the fire, water or nature attack power. Fire is stronger than nature, nature is stronger than water and water 
is stronger than fire.  Based on the health of enemy and player, i.e. for example if current health of enemy >= 30 and current health of player <= 30 then enemy miscrit will 
attack, if the situation is vice versa i.e. if current health of player >= 30 and current health of enemy <= 30 then enemy miscrit will heal. Critical attack can be done by the 
player which has 50% accuracy to hit the enemy but has power of doing high damage i.e. health of enemy miscrit will decrease a lot and this option only gets activated when the 
health of the player miscrit is less than 50%. 

# Rules of Progression: Player has to hit a tree in the jungle to start the battle. Players will start with a base miscrit with decent stats, and as they battle with more 
creatures, they can defeat it to gain points and boost their health and attack power. Whenever a player wins, he will get points and stats boost up so that he can finally face 
the boss who is a witch with more health and attack power. 

# Challenge Mechanics: The player has to strategically chose the attack, heal or critical attack options to win over the enemy miscrit and boost his stats. He has to keep on 
winning with the enemy until he feels he is strong enough to defeat the final boss witch. Defeating the new creatures adds 10% of their power to your stats. Capture the best 
Miscrits and gain as many points as you can. Winning matches and being on the top of the score board will be a challenge.
